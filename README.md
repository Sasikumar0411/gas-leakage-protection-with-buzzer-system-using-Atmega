# gas-leakage-protection-with-buzzer-system-using-Atmega
This gas leakage protection project integrates Atmega microcontrollers with gas sensor modules, a buzzer, and an LED indicator. When hazardous gas levels are detected, the system triggers the buzzer and LED to alert users, enhancing safety in environments prone to gas leaks such as kitchens and industrial settings.
